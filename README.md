# OBE:BS4 Library Design System

The OBE:BS4 Design System is a self-reflexive reference library design system based on the most popular web framework in the world, Bootstrap! The OBE:BS4 system was built specifically to give all project stakeholders full visual, technical, and tactile access to every color, font, element, component and layout for any web project.

> **Please Note:** *This project is fully functional as far as the generated CSS, JS, and library HTML files are concerned. However it will receive some substantial changes before being ready for all to use. Keep an eye on this page, to learn more about how everything works as documentation is added!*

### Installation

There are two basic ways to install the OBE:BS4 Design System. One method is to use Node.js/NPM to install the project as a node module. The other way is by 'old school' downloading the zip project, and copying the extracted files and directories into your project's root folder.

To really start using your Design System however, you'll need to use the pre-generated HTML Settings Tool page in the system to get your JSON settings to customize your Design System. (Coversely you could also get your JSON settings from the project's offical example [OBE:BS4 Library](https://library.mattmct.com/settings.html)).

*NOTE: This project uses Gulp to manage and generate the Design System Library Site. So if you are already using Gulp, be sure to not override your gulpfile.js file with the OBE:BS4 gulpfile!*

#### Installing with NPM

**Step 1**: Create a directory for your project, navigate to it in your console, nitialize NPM, and fill out your project info for your package.json file as prompted by NPM.
```bash
npm init
```

**Step 2**: Install obebs4-design-system from GitHub (NPM will install all dependencies and this codebase inside the 'node_modules' directory)
```bash
npm install --save oberocks/obebs4-design-system#master
```

<!---
**Step 3**: Use the following series of command line scripts to move the starting library files into your working directory
