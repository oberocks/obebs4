# OBE:BS4 Library Design System

The OBE:BS4 Design System is a self-reflexive reference library design system based on the most popular web framework in the world, Bootstrap! The OBE:BS4 system was built specifically to give all project stakeholders full visual, technical, and tactile access to every color, font, element, component and layout for any web project.

> **Please Note:** *This project is fully functional as far as the generated CSS, JS, and library HTML files are concerned. However it will receive some substantial changes before being ready for all to use. Keep an eye on this page, to learn more about how everything works as documentation is added!*

### Installation

There are two basic ways to install the OBE:BS4 Design System. One method is to use NPM and install the project as a node module. The other way to install the system is by 'old school' downloading the zip project, and copying the library into your project's root folder.

*NOTE: This project uses gulp as a task runner, to manage, generate, and move files into a directory. So if you are already using Gulp, be sure to not override your gulpfile.js file with the OBE:BS4 gulpfile!*

#### Installing with NPM

**Step 1**: Create a directory for your project, navigate to it in your console, nitialize NPM, and fill out your project info for your package.json file as prompted by NPM.
```bash
npm init
```

**Step 2**: Install obebs4-design-system from GitHub (NPM will install all dependencies and this codebase inside the 'node_modules' directory)
```bash
npm install --save oberocks/obebs4-design-system#master
```

<!---
**Step 3**: Use the following series of command line scripts to move the starting library files into your working directory
```bash
npm run create-obebs4-directories
```
